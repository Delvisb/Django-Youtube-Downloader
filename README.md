# Django-Youtube-Downloader

## YoutubeDownloader is a automation tool, I've created using the django framework. YoutubeDownaloder allows users to download videos directly from Youtube, and add them to their library.

### Users must first enter the url of the video they want to download.

### The system returns the video from the inputted url, with the option to download.
